\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the mathematical and visual properties of mechanical vibrations. These vibrations are visualized through a mass-spring system, where a hanging solid has its position, velocity and acceleration determined by a set of environmental variables. Mechanical vibrations are described with a set of differential equations: when solved, we can find the position equation $y(t)$. This solution was used to graph the position of an object using JavaScript in a web browser application, where the use can set the environmental variables.

In this project, we explored four types of equations, each one including different environmental factors:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Undamped Free Vibration

	\item Damped Free Vibration

	\item Undamped Forced Vibration

	\item Damped Forced Vibration
\end{enumerate} 

The simplest, Undamped Free Vibration, satisfies the homogeneous differential equation $my'' + \omega_0^2 y = 0$. This equation has a simple solution, solely depending upon the values of the spring constant $k$, the mass of the weight $m$, initial velocity $v_0$, and intial position $y_0$, and where $\omega_0^2 = k/m$

Damped Free Vibration includes a damping term upon the equation
